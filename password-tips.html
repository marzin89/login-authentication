    <h2>How to create a strong password</h2>
    <p>Don't know how to come up with a good password? Don't worry,<br>we don't 
        always know either! Our Change Password form is<br>designed to help you 
        to avoid common mistakes, but it is not<br>foolproof! Below are some 
        tips to help you increase the<br>strength of your password.</p>
    <h3>Length</h3>
    <p>A good password is a long one. Generally, the longer the better.<br>Your 
        password needs to be at least 12 characters long, but<br>there is no 
        upper limit. You can make it as long as you like!<br></p>
    <h3>Randomness</h3>
    <p>Of course, the length of your password is not the only thing<br>that matters. 
        For instance, "therevolutionwillnotbetelevised"<br>is 31 characters long, 
        but it is not very safe. A strong<br>password uses a seemingly random 
        combination of letters<br>(uppercase and lowercase), numbers and special
        characters.</p>
    <h3>Avoid the following:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dictionary words, names</strong> or combinations 
            thereof.<br>Anything that is easy to guess will be easy to crack.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Obvious substitutions.</strong> Subtsituting 
            letters for numbers<br>or special characters can be tempting, but it
            should be<br>avoided. "H3ll0W0rld" is not a whole lot safer than<br>
            "HelloWorld". It is too easy to figure out.</li>
        <li><strong>Not modifying enough.</strong> Your new password
            needs to be<br>3 characters different from your current one, but we 
            advise<br>you to go even further than that.</li>
        <li>Using your <strong>birth date, family names, your pet's
            name etc.</strong><br>Any information about you that is available 
            online<br>(Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ...) will be used by hackers
            <br>to figure out your passwords.</li>
    </ul>
